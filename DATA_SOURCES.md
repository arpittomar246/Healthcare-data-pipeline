# MediCare Healthcare Analytics — Data Sources & Privacy Documentation

## 1️ Overview
This document describes the datasets used in the **MediCare Healthcare Data Pipeline Capstone Project**.  
All data in this project is **synthetically generated** to replicate realistic Indian healthcare patterns while ensuring **complete privacy and data compliance**.  
No real patient or provider data has been used.

## 2️ Dataset Catalog

| Dataset Name | Description | Rows | Source / Generation Method | Format | Last Updated |
|---------------|-------------|------|-----------------------------|---------|---------------|
| **prescriber.csv** | Contains details of prescribers including full name, specialization, and state code. | 1,200 | Synthetic, generated using Faker (India locale) with random specialties and states. | CSV | Nov 2025 |
| **drug.csv** | Drug catalog with Indian pharmaceutical brand names, categories, and cost per unit. | 1,000 | Synthetic, curated from Indian brand references (Sun Pharma, Cipla, Lupin, Dr. Reddy’s). | CSV | Nov 2025 |
| **prescriber_drug.csv** | Mapping table showing prescriptions made by prescribers for various drugs along with counts and total cost. | 6,000 | Programmatically generated by linking prescriber and drug datasets using random sampling. | CSV | Nov 2025 |
| **eda_report.html** | Automatically generated exploratory data analysis report containing descriptive statistics, charts, and insights. | — | Produced by the ETL pipeline automatically. | HTML | Generated dynamically |
| **pipeline.log** | Log file capturing pipeline progress and errors during execution. | — | Generated by Streamlit dashboard and Python subprocess logging. | TXT | Generated dynamically |

## 3️ Data Schema & Provenance

All data is **synthetic** and programmatically generated using:
- Python’s **`faker`** library with `locale='en_IN'` for Indian context.
- Random sampling for state-wise and specialty distributions.
- Consistent foreign key relationships between prescribers and drugs.
- Anonymized, schema-consistent CSV outputs used in all pipeline stages.

No real-world medical or patient data has been accessed.

## 4️ Privacy, Ethics & Governance

-  **Privacy:** 100% synthetic data, no personal identifiers (no PHI/PII).  
-  **Anonymization:** All values (names, IDs) are randomly generated.  
-  **Storage:** All artifacts (CSV, EDA, Models, Logs) are stored under `local_data/artifacts/`.  
-  **Access Control:** Data remains local or in private GitHub repos only.  
-  **Ethics:** Project aligns with HIPAA and GDPR principles for synthetic data handling.  
-  **License:** Open use for educational/non-commercial purposes.

## 6️ Known Limitations

- All numeric and categorical distributions are approximate, not real-world clinical distributions.
- Some specialty-drug relationships may not perfectly mirror real prescription patterns.
- Model outputs are educational and not diagnostic.
